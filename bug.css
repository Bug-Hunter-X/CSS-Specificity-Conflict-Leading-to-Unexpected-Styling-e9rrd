The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where specificity conflicts can cause unexpected styling behavior.  The `#myDiv p` selector has higher specificity than the `.myClass p` selector, resulting in the text color being overridden to red, even though `.myClass p` appears later in the stylesheet. This can be especially confusing when dealing with numerous selectors and complex inheritance.

```css
.myClass p {
  color: blue;
}

#myDiv p {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

```html
<div id="myDiv">
  <p class="myClass">This text should be blue, but is red due to specificity.</p>
</div>
```
